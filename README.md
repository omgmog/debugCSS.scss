# What is this?

You may have seen [debugCSS](https://github.com/yahoo/debugCSS) before. This is pretty much the same thing, but with the magic of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).

By factoring out codifying the repeated selectors and their various rules, `debugCSS.scss` is a lot easier to maintain.

See the [debugCSS Readme](https://github.com/yahoo/debugCSS/blob/master/README.md) if you're confused about anything.

## Usage

To use this, you can either embed the `debugCSS.css` in your project, to see if you've got any errors in the way you're using (X)HTML.

Or you could use the handy bookmarklet to try it out on any site:

``` javascript
javascript:(function(d,i,l){l=d.getElementById(i);if(l){l.parentNode.removeChild(l);return;}l=d.createElement('link');l.id=i;l.rel='stylesheet';l.type='text/css';l.href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omgmog/debugCSS.scss/master/debugCSS.css';d.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(l);}(document,'debugCSS'))
```
